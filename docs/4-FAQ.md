#### Intro to PGP

PGP encryption is know as one of the best ways to protect the contents of your messages, text, and even files.

The way that this works is through Private and Public key Pairings. The private key you create, along the public key it generates, are your two main tools to safely identify yourself across unsafe communication platforms.

The private key allows you to sign and encrypt messages and identify you (or whoever holds it) as the true sender of the signed message, while the public key, if sent to someone who wants to contact you, or received from someone you want to contact, allows you to encode messages so only those specific people can decode the contents.

PGP encryption allows us to securely identify ownership of accounts through secure keys.

On top of this, your key access as well can be protected with a password any time you use it.

#### PGP Key generation

Keys should use RSA for both signing and encrypting.

The RSA key should be at least 2048 bits length, but preferably 4096 bits.

Set your key with a Expiration date, in case you lose access to your keys in the future, your identity will not be on the lose.

#### Key Storage

Do not share your private key with anyone. You must guard your private key very carefully.

You may share and publish your Public key, for it can only be used to encode messages that only you can open.

Hardware based PGP Keys, like Yubico Keys, are the highest standard of identity security. We encourage you use them.
